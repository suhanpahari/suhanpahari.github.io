Hello!

I'm Soham Pahari, a final-year Computer Science (Data Science) student specializing in machine learning, deep learning, and applied AI research. I work across multimodal learning, vision transformers, personality modeling, drug discovery frameworks, and optimization-driven forecasting models.

I have industry and research experience through roles at **Bahas Pvt Ltd** and **NIT Warangal (Dept. of AI)**, where I led and contributed to projects in emotion classification, molecular sequence generation, and high-performance model training on large-scale GPU systems. My work spans transformer-based architectures, multimodal reasoning, and scalable ML engineering.

Some of my recent research highlights include:
- **Developing AMoE-ViT**, an Adaptive Mixture of Orthogonal Experts Vision Transformer for self-supervised agricultural disease diagnosis.
- **TriadNet**, a multimodal system integrating graph-based facial dynamics, prosody-aware speech modeling, and BERT-LSTM textual flow to estimate Big Five personality traits.
- Leading a **1.13M-sample drug–indication generation project** as a research intern and achieving strong improvements over baseline molecular benchmarks.
- Building multiple ML solutions including AQI forecasting models, interview simulation systems, and emotion recognition applications.

I’ve presented my work at conferences such as **COMSYS 2025 (Warsaw University of Technology)**, **KEDAR 2025**, and **CIACON 2025**, and I am also the recipient of the **SHODH Research Grant** for an IoT-driven agricultural system.

Outside of research, I enjoy working on end-to-end systems, exploring applied AI for real-world impact, and competing in hackathons—recently placing **top 200 out of 17,000** participants at Hackahazard 2025 and winning the **Smart India Hackathon internal round**.

If you're interested in machine learning research, multimodal AI, or applied deep learning engineering, I’d love to connect.
